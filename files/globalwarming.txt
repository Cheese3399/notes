Global warming refers to the long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere. This warming trend is primarily caused by the increased concentration of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which trap heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.
